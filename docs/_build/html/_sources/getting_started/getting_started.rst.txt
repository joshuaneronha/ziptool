Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Ziptool requires Python >= 3.8.0. Install using :code:`pip`:

::

  pip install ziptool

Obtaining Data
--------------

Ziptool extracts information from ACS data. Data of the following forms can be
used:

1. Downloaded, rectangular CSV that contains your variables of interest. You
   can register at https://usa.ipums.org/ and download the data you would like.

2. pd.DataFrame generated by `ipumspy <https://ipumspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
   a convenient Python package that uses the IPUMS API to generate a pd.DataFrame
   with the data you want.

Extracting ZIP-level Data
-------------------------

The top-level function used to extract data by ZIP code is :code:`data_by_zip`.
Assuming that you have downloaded your data as a CSV, you might use the following
code to query data, assuming that you are interested in the education and
household income for the zip codes 79901 and 02835.

::

  from ziptool import data_by_zip

  data_by_zip(['02835','79901'],path_to_csv,
      {"HHINCOME": {"null": 9999999, "type":'household'},
           "EDUC": {"null": 0, "type": 'individual'}})

You can provide as many ZIP codes as you would like, and as many variables, too.
You must provide the null value for a variable and its type (household or
individual), both of which are readily available from the IPUMS codebook.
